# `@mcpjam/sdk` changelog

## Unreleased — Stage 5 Step 3 (eval reporter wire-sends hostConfig)

- Eval reporter now sends `{ hostConfig, hostConfigHash }` on `POST /sdk/v1/evals/runs/start` and `POST /sdk/v1/evals/report` when the backend advertises `evalsHostConfig` at `GET /sdk/v1/info`. Lazy capability probe is cached per `baseUrl` and **fail-safe to "no capability"** — any error (network / 404 / timeout / parse) makes the reporter omit `hostConfig` rather than fail the report.
- Source order for the run-level host snapshot: `iteration.hostSnapshot` → `executor.getHostSnapshot?.()` → `MCPJamReportingConfig.host`. Pass-1 homogeneity gate: send run-level only when all available iteration snapshots canonicalize to the same hash; heterogeneous runs omit the field (per-iteration wire support is a later stage).
- Old backends without the capability are unaffected — body shape stays the same.

## 1.12.0

### Stage 5 Step 1 — SDK helper for backend ingestion

- New helper `normalizeSdkEvalHostConfigForWire` exported from `@mcpjam/sdk/host-config/internal` (not the public barrel). Strips runtime-manager identifiers (`serverIds`, `optionalServerIds`, `serverConnectionOverrides`) so the SDK reporter and the `/sdk/v1/evals/*` ingestion route hash byte-identical wire shapes. Accepts both canonical `HostConfigInputV2` and public `HostJson` from `Host.toJSON()`. Pure, browser-safe, idempotent.

### Stage B — Canonicalizer tightening

- Deep-sort nested `clientCapabilities` / `hostContext` records (matches `*Override` + `mcpProfile`).
- Drop empty `allowFeatures` from canonical (matches sibling `openaiAppsOverrides`).
- `requireRecord` helper fails fast on missing required `clientCapabilities` / `hostContext` (replaces `?? {}` coalescing — surfaces caller bugs at canonicalize time).
- Drop `openaiAppsOverrides` when `compatRuntime.openaiApps === false` (the resolver ignores them anyway).
- Tightened the shared `isPlainObject` predicate with a prototype guard (`Object.prototype` or `null`) so `Date` / `Map` / `Set` / class instances no longer canonicalize to `{}`.
- Hash-neutral against all 15,389 prod `hostConfigs` rows at the time of release. Backend consumers should bump to `^1.12.0` to pick up the tightened behavior.

## 1.11.0 — Stage 4 (HostRunner rename + HostRuntime binding)

**Breaking changes** — major-style rename shipped under 1.11.0 because there were no public adopters at the time.

### Renamed surface

- `TestAgent` → `HostRunner` (class) and `TestAgentConfig` → `HostRunnerConfig`.
- `EvalAgent` → `HostExecutor` (interface). `HostRunner` and `HostRuntime` both implement it.
- `.prompt(message, options)` → `.run(message, options)` on `HostRunner`, `HostRuntime`, and the `HostExecutor` interface.
- `Host.addServer(id)` → `Host.requireServer(id)`.
- `Host.removeServer(id)` → `Host.removeRequiredServer(id)`.
- `EvalTest.run(agent, options)` / `EvalSuite.run(agent, options)` now take a `HostExecutor` (parameter renamed to `executor`).

No deprecation aliases. Pre-Stage-4 names are removed.

### `Host` becomes the primary spec

- `HostRunnerConfig.host` accepts `Host | HostInit | HostJson`. When supplied, the runner derives defaults for `model`, `systemPrompt`, `temperature`, and `injectOpenAiCompat` from the host snapshot (explicit fields still win).
- `HostRunnerConfig` is now a discriminated union: callers supply either a `host` (with optional `model`) **or** an explicit `model`. A config missing both is a compile-time error.
- `HostRunner` snapshots the host once at construction via `snapshotHostSource(...)`. A pre-snapshotted `HostJson` (e.g. one produced by `HostRuntime.run()`) passes through untouched — no double-snapshot. Post-construction mutations to the original `Host` do NOT affect the runner.
- New public accessors on `HostRunner`: `getHostSnapshot()`, `getHostPolicy()`.

### New: `HostRuntime` — live binding of a `Host` to a manager

- `host.withManager(manager, { apiKey, ...defaults })` returns a `HostRuntime`. `apiKey` lives on the runtime, not per-call.
- `HostRuntime.run(input, options?)`:
  - Snapshots the live `Host` on every call.
  - Validates required server ids against the manager (`assertHostServersKnown`).
  - Resolves the active tool set via `manager.getToolsForAiSdk(serverIds, { includeAppOnly: policy.respectToolVisibility === false })`.
  - Dynamically imports `HostRunner` and delegates execution.
- **Stateless across turns**: prior `PromptResult`s accumulate in `getPromptHistory()` for inspection but are NOT auto-replayed into the next turn. Multi-turn continuity stays explicit via `PromptOptions.context`.
- The `HostRuntimeManager` shape is structural (`hasServer` + `getToolsForAiSdk`); `MCPClientManager` satisfies it without a static dependency from the `host-config` bundle.
- `HostRuntime` lives in `sdk/src/host-config/` and stays browser-safe — the `HostRunner` import is dynamic, so bundlers can split it into a separate chunk.

### New: `host.run()` one-shot sugar

```ts
await host.run("write me a haiku", {
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY!,
  mcpClientManager,
});
```

Internally constructs a throwaway `HostRuntime` and delegates. No shared state across calls.

### New: `EvalTest` / `EvalSuite` stamp host-derived metadata

- When the executor implements `getHostSnapshot?.()`, `EvalTest` and `EvalSuite` derive a host metadata stamp (`buildHostSnapshotMetadata`) and additively merge it into each `EvalResultInput.metadata`. Existing keys (`retryCount`, `iterationNumber`, …) are never overwritten — conflicting host keys are namespaced under `host.<key>`.
- `MCPJamReportingConfig.host?: Host` field added. Wire-level `hostConfigHash` propagation is deferred to a follow-up stage; the field is accepted but not yet sent.

### Single-gated app-only filter + SDK-owned OpenAI-compat injection

- SEP-1865 `_meta.ui.visibility = ["app"]` filtering happens once at `HostRunner`'s tool-prep step, gated by `hostPolicy.respectToolVisibility !== false` (default = filter). The inline drop inside `convertToToolSet` is removed.
- The OpenAI Apps compat decision (`resolveOpenAiCompatForHostConfig`) is derived from the host snapshot by default and applied via the existing SDK `injectOpenAICompat` primitive on captured widget snapshots.

### Codemod for callers

```sh
sd 'TestAgent' 'HostRunner' $(rg -l 'TestAgent' sdk examples)
sd 'EvalAgent' 'HostExecutor' $(rg -l 'EvalAgent' sdk examples)
sd '\.prompt\(' '.run(' $(rg -l '\.prompt\(' sdk examples)
sd 'prompt: \(' 'run: (' $(rg -l 'prompt: \(' sdk examples)
```

(Object-literal mocks that wrote `prompt: async (...) => ...` need the same `prompt:` → `run:` rename; bare `prompt(` method declarations on interfaces likewise.)

### Inspector

No behavior changes. Imports of the Stage 3 helpers (`extractHostExecutionPolicy`, `applyVisibilityPolicyAndCountSignals`, `resolveOpenAiCompatForHostConfig`) move from the inspector's local re-export files to `@mcpjam/sdk/host-config/internal`. The inspector-only `host-execution-policy.ts` shim is deleted; `compat-runtime.ts` keeps only the Convex-bound `loadSuiteHostConfig`.
