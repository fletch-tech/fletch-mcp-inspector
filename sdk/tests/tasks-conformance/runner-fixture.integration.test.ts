/**
 * The Tasks conformance runner driven END TO END against the raw extension
 * fixture over a real socket — no mocked `withEphemeralClient`, no mocked
 * `ManagedMcpClient`.
 *
 * `runner.test.ts` covers the runner's decision logic against a hand-built
 * fake manager. That is necessary but not sufficient: it cannot catch a probe
 * that never reaches the wire, because a fake manager answers whatever the
 * test wants. Both bugs this file exists to pin were exactly that shape —
 * a `tools/list` the modern decoder refused (so DISCOVERY died before any
 * Tasks check ran) and an undeclared-capability probe that threw locally (so
 * the `-32003` requirement was never put to the server).
 *
 * So the assertions here are deliberately about the WIRE: the fixture's
 * `received` log is the witness that each probe actually left the process,
 * and each check's verdict is asserted in BOTH directions — conformant
 * fixture passes, misbehaving fixture fails and names the offending method.
