/**
 * Per-call shadow that puts the `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` eligibility
 * declaration onto exactly ONE `subscriptions/listen` request.
 *
 * ## Why a seam is needed at all
 *
 * SEP-2663 delivers optional `notifications/tasks` over a task-filtered
 * `subscriptions/listen`, and — like every other extension operation — that
 * listen request MUST carry the per-request eligibility declaration in
 * `params._meta["io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities"]`. A non-declaring
 * client gets `-32003`.
 *
 * `Client.listen(filter, options)` has no `_meta` parameter. It builds its own
 * request body (`client dist/index.mjs:3706-3713`):
 *
 * ```js
 * params: { _meta: { ...this._outboundMetaEnvelope() }, notifications: filter }
 * ```
 *
 * `RequestOptions` carries `signal` / `timeout` / progress and nothing that
 * reaches `params._meta`. So there is no public way to declare on a listen.
 *
 * ## Why the filter itself is fine
 *
 * Note what that same line does with the filter: `notifications: filter`,
 * verbatim. Upstream validates `SubscriptionFilterSchema` nowhere on the send
 * path, so the extension's `taskIds` member reaches the wire unmodified even
 * though upstream's own type does not know about it. Only `_meta` needs help.
 *
 * ## The shape of the fix
 *
 * The same discipline as `tasks-ext-era-gate.ts`: a narrowly scoped,
 * per-instance override of one private upstream member, installed for the
 * shortest possible window and removed immediately.
 *
 * The window can be made exact because `listen()`'s prologue is **fully
 * synchronous** up to and including the line above — transport check, era
 * check, promise wiring, `_listenState.set`, the ack timer, the abort listener,
 * then the request literal. The first `await` is the `transport.send` that
 * follows. So:
 *
 * ```ts
 * install();
 * const pending = client.listen(filter, options); // envelope read, synchronously
 * restore();                                       // nothing else can observe it
 * return await pending;
 * ```
 *
 * `restore()` runs in the same synchronous turn as the read, so no other
 * request — on this client or any other — can pick up the widened envelope.
 * That is what keeps the declaration per-request rather than connection-wide;
 * `registerCapabilities()` would have been the easy path and is exactly the
 * thing SEP-2663's per-request opt-in forbids.
 *
 * ## Maintenance
 *
 * REVISIT ON EVERY `@modelcontextprotocol/client` BUMP. Two things could break
 * it, and both fail loudly rather than silently dropping the declaration:
 *
 *  - the private member is renamed or removed ⇒
 *    {@link TasksExtListenMetaSeamError} on the attempted listen;
 *  - the prologue stops being synchronous (an `await` moves above the request
 *    literal) ⇒ the post-call verification below sees the override was never
 *    invoked and throws.
 *
 * Delete this module once the client package accepts caller `_meta` on
 * `listen()`.
