/**
 * `ManagedMcpClient` is the surface area `MCPClientManager` calls into for
 * every server connection. It exists so the manager can swap between the
 * legacy upstream `Client` (via `OfficialSdkClientAdapter`) and the
 * stateless 2026-07-28 preview transport
 * (`StatelessMcpHttpPreviewClient`) without per-call branching. Selection
 * is driven by the per-server `mcpProtocolVersion` pin (`McpProtocolVersion`
 * in `./mcp-protocol-version.ts`) — the factory uses
 * `isStatelessProtocolVersion` to route.
 *
 * **Coverage rationale.** The shape below was derived by grepping
 * `MCPClientManager.ts` for every `client.*` call site, plus
 * `elicitation.ts`'s `removeRequestHandler(ElicitRequestMethod)` cleanup
 * and the manager's `subscribeResource` / `unsubscribeResource`
 * passthrough. Omitting any method would crash the manager — there is no
 * `client?.foo()` fallback for unknown surface.
 *
 * **Disposable-by-design.** When upstream `@modelcontextprotocol/client`
 * adds stateless support, replacement is a one-line factory swap to a
 * new `OfficialSdkClientAdapter` configured for the new wire literal.
 * No manager-side churn, no product / UI / config unwind.
