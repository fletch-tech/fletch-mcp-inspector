/**
 * Per-instance shadow of the upstream client's OUTBOUND era gate, scoped to
 * the three `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` (SEP-2663) extension methods.
 *
 * ## What upstream does
 *
 * `@modelcontextprotocol/client@2.0.0-beta.4` derives a "spec method universe"
 * from the UNION of its two era registries
 * (`isSpecRequestMethod`, `src-*.mjs:3964`: `ALL_CODECS.some(c =>
 * c.hasRequestMethod(m))`, with `ALL_CODECS = [rev2025Codec, rev2026Codec]`).
 * `Protocol._assertOutboundRequestInEra` (`src-*.mjs:5932`) then throws
 * `METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_PROTOCOL_VERSION` for any member of that union that
 * the NEGOTIATED era's codec does not define. It is called from all three send
 * paths: `request()` (`:5886`), `_requestWithSchema()` (`:5951`) and
 * `ctx.mcpReq.send` (`:5791`) — "an explicit schema never smuggles a deleted
 * method onto the wire".
 *
 * ## Why that is wrong for this extension
 *
 * `tasks/get`, `tasks/result`, `tasks/list` and `tasks/cancel` are members of
 * the union solely via the **2025-11-25** registry (`src-*.mjs:2048-2051`),
 * which is where the *in-core* tasks utility lived. The 2026-07-28 registry
 * (`:3685-3695`) has none of them, because that utility was DELETED from core
 * and reborn as this extension — which reuses two of the same method names.
 * So on a 2026-07-28 connection the client refuses to send the EXTENSION's
 * `tasks/get` / `tasks/cancel`, reading them as deleted core methods. They are
 * collateral damage of a name collision, not of a real deletion. (`tasks/update`
 * is in neither registry, so it is era-blind and needs nothing from here — it
 * is listed anyway so the exemption set is exactly the extension's method set
 * rather than a hand-picked subset that would rot the moment a registry moves.)
 *
 * The era gate is a v2-only construct; the extension was authored against SDK
 * v1, where no such gate exists. There is no public seam to fix this properly:
 * the registries are module-private, the codec surface is function-only, and
 * `Protocol` is not exported — so this installs an own-property shadow on the
 * one instance we constructed.
 *
 * ## Why it is provably inert on the legacy revisions
 *
 * The early return requires `codec.era === "2026-07-28"`. `codecForVersion`
 * (`src-*.mjs:3942`) maps every legacy revision — 2025-03-26, 2025-06-18,
 * 2025-11-25, and `undefined` — to `rev2025Codec`, whose `era` is
 * `"2025-11-25"` (`:2214`). On any of those connections the shadow delegates
 * unconditionally, so `tasks/get`/`tasks/cancel` keep taking the legacy
 * in-core path (`tasks.ts`) with byte-identical behavior.
 *
 * `codec.era` is compared rather than our own negotiated-version constant on
 * purpose: upstream resolves ANY modern revision (including a pinned draft
 * that is not the literal `2026-07-28`) to `rev2026Codec`, and the era string
 * is what the gate itself reads. Comparing a protocol-version constant would
 * miss those and silently re-block the extension.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT done
 *
 * Pinning the tasks methods to the 2025 codec instead. `rev2025Codec
 * .outboundEnvelope` returns `undefined` (`:2240`) whereas `rev2026Codec
 * .outboundEnvelope` (`:3800`) attaches the
 * `io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities` `_meta` envelope that the
 * extension's per-request eligibility declaration rides in — a codec swap
 * would silently strip the declaration and earn a `-32003` from every
 * conforming server.
 *
 * ## When it is installed, and why not at connect
 *
 * LAZILY, on the first `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` operation — never at
 * client construction or connect. The factory only *registers* the upstream
 * instance behind its `ManagedMcpClient`
 * ({@link registerTasksExtensionEraGateTarget}); the shadow itself is put on
 * by {@link ensureTasksExtensionEraGateShadow}, which `tasks-ext.ts` calls
 * from the single send path shared by `tasks/get`, `tasks/update` and
 * `tasks/cancel`.
 *
 * Registration is a fast path, never a precondition: a `ManagedMcpClient` that
 * did NOT come from the factory (a directly-constructed
 * `OfficialSdkClientAdapter`, say) is resolved by walking its public
 * `ManagedMcpClient.inner` delegation chain, so it gets the same shadow. The
 * only case that installs nothing is a chain with no upstream client in it at
 * all — a test double, which has no era gate to shadow. See
 * {@link resolveTasksExtensionEraGateTarget}.
 *
 * The reason is blast radius. This module probes a PRIVATE upstream member,
 * and a bump that renames it must fail loudly (see Maintenance) — but that
 * failure has to land on the feature that depends on the probe, not on the
 * transport. Installing at connect would put a private-member probe on the
 * critical path of EVERY connection: a renamed member would break 2025-03-26,
 * 2025-06-18, 2025-11-25 and 2026-07-28 servers alike, including the vast
 * majority that never speak this extension. So we do NOT gate connections on
 * it. A connection is never denied because of a seam we only need for tasks;
 * the seam error can only ever surface on a tasks request.
 *
 * ## Maintenance
 *
 * REVISIT ON EVERY `@modelcontextprotocol/client` BUMP. If the private member
 * is renamed or removed, {@link installTasksExtensionEraGateShadow} throws on
 * the first extension tasks operation rather than silently no-opping, so a
 * bump that re-blocks the extension fails loudly instead of shipping a dead
 * debugger surface. Delete this module once the client package stops
 * era-gating the extension's method names (or exposes a real seam).
