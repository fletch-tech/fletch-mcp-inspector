/**
 * MCPJam response-cache POLICY (SEP-2549). This is the single source of truth
 * for how the debugger disposes of the client's response cache; the code above
 * and the raw-evidence surfaces (`server-snapshot`, `server-doctor`,
 * `mcp-conformance`) implement it.
 *
 * 1. **Default UI reads use `"use"`.** A default read MAY be served from cache
 *    — but ONLY when (a) the server sent `ttlMs > 0` (so the entry is fresh)
 *    AND (b) MCPJam surfaces the serve's provenance and age to the operator
 *    (via {@link CacheEventLogger}). A serve the operator cannot see is
 *    indistinguishable from a fabricated wire response and is forbidden.
 * 2. **`defaultCacheTtlMs` stays `0`.** A result WITHOUT a server `ttlMs` is
 *    stored (so the client's `tools/list`-derived index keeps working) but is
 *    NEVER served. Invisible serving therefore happens EXACTLY when a server
 *    opts in with `ttlMs > 0`.
 * 3. **"Refresh" ⇒ `cacheMode: "refresh"`.** The refresh affordance always
 *    fetches and re-stores.
 * 4. **Raw / conformance ⇒ `cacheMode: "bypass"`.** Evidence surfaces neither
 *    consult nor write the cache.
 *
 * ### Explicitly DEFERRED: persisted-discovery (`prior`) reconnect
 *
 * The upstream client supports a zero-round-trip reconnect by adopting a prior
 * {@link import("@modelcontextprotocol/client").DiscoverResult} on `connect`
 * (`ConnectOptions.prior`). MCPJam does NOT implement this here — it is
 * deferred pending owner sign-off on how to display the provenance of an
 * adopted-without-a-handshake connection. When implemented, the persisted
 * `DiscoverResult` MUST be keyed by the full authorization/negotiation context
 * so a cached discovery is never reused across a different principal or a
 * different negotiated shape. The intended key spec is:
 *
 *   - server ORIGIN (scheme + host + port of the MCP endpoint),
 *   - AUTH / TENANT context (the same identity that scopes the response cache
 *     partition — e.g. the auth subject / `cachePartition`), and
 *   - NEGOTIATION INPUTS (proposed protocol-version accept-list + advertised
 *     client capabilities) that produced the `DiscoverResult`.
 *
 * Do NOT reuse a `prior` across any change in those inputs.

   * `modern` is a merge-style overlay (same semantics as `capabilities`)

   * - After that single application the declaration is STABLE for the
   *   connection's lifetime — MRTR rounds of one logical operation always
   *   see one consistent set.
   * - A connection that lands on a 2025 era never applies the overlay, and
   *   its `initialize` already carried the conservative base: fail-closed.
