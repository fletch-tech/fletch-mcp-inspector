/**
 * Era-neutral subscription coordinator (MCP 2026-07-28 `subscriptions/listen`).
 *
 * ## Why this is not "the legacy model plus a new RPC"
 *
 * The 2025-era model is a *set of subscribed resource URIs* plus unsolicited
 * list-changed notifications that arrive on whatever channel the transport
 * happens to keep open. There is no stream identity, no acknowledgement, no
 * close reason, and no way for a debugger to show what the server actually
 * agreed to send.
 *
 * The 2026-07-28 model is a *long-lived, explicitly-filtered stream*: the
 * client sends `subscriptions/listen` with a filter, the server replies with
 * `notifications/subscriptions/acknowledged` carrying the subset it agreed to
 * honor, every subsequent notification is stamped with the subscription id,
 * and the stream ends either gracefully (an empty `subscriptions/listen`
 * result), remotely (transport loss, no result), or locally (client abort).
 *
 * So the product state model here is era-neutral and adapter-specific:
 *
 *   - **Desired interests** — what the user wants, independent of era:
 *     tools/prompts/resources list-changed toggles plus a set of resource URIs
 *     ({@link DesiredSubscriptionInterests}).
 *   - **Streams** — zero or more {@link SubscriptionStreamRecord}s, each with a
 *     local MCPJam id, the MCP subscription id (when known), the *requested*
 *     filter, the *acknowledged* filter (tracked separately — they are not the
 *     same fact), a status, lifecycle timestamps, and a reconnect attempt
 *     counter.
 *   - **Legacy adapter** — the existing list-changed handlers plus
 *     `resources/subscribe` / `resources/unsubscribe` per URI, modelled as one
 *     synthetic stream so the debugger has a single shape to render.
 *   - **Modern adapter** — an explicit `client.listen(filter)`. Resource URIs
 *     ride in `resourceSubscriptions`. Changing the desired filter closes and
 *     reopens the stream (a filter is fixed for the life of a subscription);
 *     an unexpected remote loss triggers a bounded re-*listen* — never a
 *     resume, since there is no `Last-Event-ID`/replay for listen streams.
 *
 * ## Deliberate choices
 *
 * - **Explicit `listen()` over `ClientOptions.listChanged`.** The auto-opened
 *   subscription hides the requested filter, the subscription identity, the
 *   ack timing and the close reason — exactly the facts a debugger exists to
 *   show. MCPJam always drives `listen()` itself.
 * - **Advertise = enforce, and show the absence.** A selection the server does
 *   not advertise is *omitted* from the requested filter and recorded as
 *   {@link SubscriptionInterestRejection} so the UI can render it as rejected
 *   rather than silently dropping it.
 * - **Ack before active.** A stream stays `opening` until the acknowledgement
 *   is observed; only then does it become `active` with an acknowledged filter.
 * - **Handlers registered once, demultiplexed by subscription id.** Multiple
 *   concurrent subscriptions are legal, so per-stream handler registration
 *   would fan a single notification out to the wrong streams.
 * - **Unrequested notification types are rejected**, recorded, and not
 *   delivered.
 * - **Request-scoped notifications stay out of this store.** `notifications/
 *   progress` and `notifications/message` belong to the originating request
 *   stream; the coordinator never registers handlers for them, and rejects
 *   them if a caller asks for them.
 *
 * All exports in this module are new; nothing existing changes shape.
