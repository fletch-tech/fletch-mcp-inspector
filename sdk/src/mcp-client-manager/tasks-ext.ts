/**
 * `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` (SEP-2663) client operations.
 *
 * The extension is server-decided: a client never asks for a task, it declares
 * per request that it is *eligible* to receive one. That declaration rides in
 * `params._meta["io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities"]` and MUST be
 * present on every extension operation — the `tools/call` that may produce a
 * task AND the subsequent `tasks/get` / `tasks/update` / `tasks/cancel`
 * (`-32003` otherwise).
 *
 * ## The beta.4 envelope seam (investigated, PR2)
 *
 * On a modern connection beta.4 auto-attaches a complete per-request `_meta`
 * envelope — protocol version, client info, client capabilities (client
 * `dist/index.mjs:2863 _outboundMetaEnvelope`, built from the client-level
 * `this._capabilities`). `Protocol._envelopeOutbound` then merges it with the
 * caller's `_meta` **one key deep**:
 *
 * ```js
 * _meta: { ...envelope, ...params._meta }   // user keys win, per key
 * ```
 *
 * So there is NO per-request seam for *extending* the declared capabilities:
 * writing `_meta[CLIENT_CAPABILITIES_META_KEY]` replaces beta.4's whole
 * capabilities object. The only other seam, `registerCapabilities()`, is
 * connection-wide — it would declare task eligibility on every request, which
 * the spec's per-request opt-in (and the UI's per-call "Allow task response"
 * toggle) forbids.
 *
 * Therefore {@link buildTasksExtensionRequestMeta} **reconstructs the full
 * envelope value**: it merges the tasks extension into the exact
 * `ClientCapabilities` object the manager passed to `new Client(...)` (the
 * same object beta.4 copied into `_capabilities`), reusing
 * `mergeClientCapabilities`' extension-map semantics so no unrelated extension
 * entry is dropped. The protocol-version and client-info envelope keys are
 * never written here, so beta.4's auto-generated values for them survive
 * untouched. `tasks-ext.test.ts` pins the no-clobbering property.
 *
 * ## Getting the three methods onto the wire at all
 *
 * Two separate upstream constructs stand between these helpers and a socket,
 * and BOTH have to be dealt with:
 *
 * 1. the result-schema seam — solved here, by sending every extension request
 *    through `requestWithSchema` (see {@link TASKS_EXT_WIRE_RESULT_SCHEMA});
 * 2. the outbound era gate — solved by `tasks-ext-era-gate.ts`, which is where
 *    the reasoning lives. Its shadow is installed LAZILY, from
 *    {@link sendTasksExtRequest} below: it probes a private upstream member,
 *    so it must not sit on the connect path of servers that never speak this
 *    extension.
