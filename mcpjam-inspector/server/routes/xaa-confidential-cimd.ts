/**
 * Stateless confidential-CIMD reflector. The client encodes its PUBLIC key in
 * the URL; this route decodes it and echoes it into a `private_key_jwt` Client
 * ID Metadata Document. Each key → a unique HTTPS URL, with no server storage.
 * The client proves ownership by signing a `client_assertion` with the matching
 * private key (which never leaves the client). Public/anonymous (outside /api),
 * DIRECT 200, no redirects — the authorization server fetches it itself.
 *
 * `client_id` is the exact URL this document was fetched from (proxy-forwarded
 * headers honored), so it byte-matches the URL the client presented — CIMD
 * requires `doc.client_id === fetched URL`. Deriving it from the request is safe
 * here (unlike the sibling public doc's fixed identity): the URL contains the
 * key, so a spoofed host just produces a non-matching client_id and fails; only
 * the private-key holder can authenticate.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — the reflected identity is EXPLICITLY UNTRUSTED and UNBRANDED.
 * Anyone can publish an arbitrary public key here, so the document must not
 * carry MCPJam branding (name/logo/uri): possession proves control of the
 * client_id, never that MCPJam issued or endorses the client. The decoder also
 * strictly validates an exact public P-256 JWK and strips any private/unknown
 * members, so the reflector can only ever serve a clean public key.
