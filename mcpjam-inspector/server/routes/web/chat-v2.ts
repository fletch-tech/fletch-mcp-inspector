    // ── Phase 4: the chatbox's own EPHEMERAL sandbox ────────────────────────
    // An env-backed chatbox whose backend says `computerSandbox: 'ephemeral'`
    // runs bash on a per-CONVERSATION disposable box booted from the
    // ENVIRONMENT's pinned image — not on the acting member's persistent
    // personal computer, which every conversation that member opened used to
    // share (with their project files already in it).
    //
    // Get-or-create, so the first bash-advertising turn boots it and every
    // later turn of the same conversation gets the SAME box back. There is
    // deliberately NO release here: the box belongs to the conversation, not
    // the turn, and the backend's idle reaper (20 min since last use, 4h
    // ceiling) owns its teardown. Releasing per turn would break every
    // multi-step `cd`/write/run workflow a shell exists for.
    //
    // ABSENT marker ⇒ old backend (or an environment with no image pinned) ⇒
    // today's personal-computer behaviour, untouched.
    // Only a CHATBOX runtime config ever carries the marker (`computerSandbox`
    // is projected by `buildEnvironmentChatboxRuntimeConfig` alone), so a
    // host-bound Playground turn never reads it.
    //
    // HARNESS TURNS ARE EXCLUDED, and not merely because harness-on-chatbox is
    // Phase 6. `run-harness-turn.ts` resolves its OWN machine through
    // `resolveHarnessSandbox` — the acting member's personal computer — and
    // `prepare.builtInTools` is forwarded to it verbatim alongside the MCP
    // plane. Provisioning here would therefore produce a MIXED-MACHINE turn:
    // the model's `bash` on the ephemeral box, the harness's own Shell and file
    // edits on the personal one, with no relationship between the two
    // filesystems. It would also suppress the image context that IS correct for
    // the harness's machine. Leaving harness turns entirely alone is the only
    // coherent state until Phase 6 moves the harness onto the same box.
    //
    // ORDERING: this block sits AFTER the manager authorization and the body
    // validations on purpose. Provisioning is the step that spends money, so a
    // turn that is going to be rejected (malformed `appTools`, an MCP auth
    // failure) must be rejected BEFORE it can acquire a paid box. Nothing
    // between here and the `streamWebChatTurn` call reads `builtInTools` or
    // `effectiveSystemPrompt`, which is what makes the late placement free.
