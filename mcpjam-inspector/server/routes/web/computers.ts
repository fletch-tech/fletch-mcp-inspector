/**
 * Project Computers — web routes for the data-plane split.
 *
 *   GET  /config  (open)    Which data plane serves this inspector: itself
 *                           (`localConfigured`, it holds the vendor key +
 *                           secrets) or a deployed one (`remoteDataPlaneUrl`,
 *                           the NON-secret COMPUTERS_REMOTE_DATA_PLANE_URL —
 *                           explicit, or auto-discovered via Convex; see
 *                           remote-data-plane.ts). Awaits any in-flight
 *                           discovery so the client's cached first answer is
 *                           never a false negative. The client uses this to
 *                           aim the terminal WebSocket and to render an
 *                           honest empty state when neither is available.
 *                           No secrets here — a boolean and a public URL.
 *
 *   POST /exec    (bearer)  Run one command on the CALLER'S computer. This is
 *                           what a credential-less local inspector forwards
 *                           its `bash` tool calls to (remote-data-plane.ts).
 *                           Authorization is the user's bearer end to end:
 *                           it's forwarded to Convex `/computers/reserve`,
 *                           which only ever resolves the (project, user)
 *                           computer of the bearer's owner — the shared
 *                           secret stays on this server. Returns the bash
 *                           tool's result shape; soft failures are
 *                           `{ error }` with HTTP 200 so the delegating
 *                           tool can relay them conversationally.
 *                           This route never delegates further — an
 *                           unconfigured server reports `{ error }`, so a
 *                           misconfigured remote URL can't forward in a loop.
