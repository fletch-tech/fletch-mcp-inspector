 * the local singleton manager feeds). Subscribing the turn's collector to the
 * bus for its selected servers routes those entries into the SAME delivery the
 * emulated engine uses (`data-rpc-log` stream parts / response envelope), so
 * the Playground Logs panel fills for harness turns with zero client changes.
 *
 * Covers the SAME-INSTANCE case: the bus is per-process, so this alone handles
 * local dev and self-hosted. On the horizontally-scaled hosted plane a
 * harness-mcp request may land on another instance; those frames are pulled from
 * the shared Convex sink by `startCrossInstanceRpcLogPoll` (COMP-21), which pairs
 * with this bridge — start both, tear both down.
 *
 * Scoped by serverId only (the proxy token carries no turn id), so a
 * concurrent turn against the same server on this instance would also see the
 * entries — same per-server semantics as the local-mode Logs SSE.
 *
 * Returns the unsubscribe; callers MUST run it on stream completion or the
 * collector (and its closed writer) leak on the bus for the process lifetime.

 * server can yield zero frames while the scan still advanced (deriving the
 * cursor from delivered frames would stall that server for the rest of the
 * turn); and a single global cursor would let a busy server drag a quiet one
 * past rows it hasn't flushed yet.
 *
 * No-op when the sink isn't configured (single-instance / self-hosted) or the
