/**
 * browser-session-context.ts — per-session browser-rendered MCP App context for
 * any runner that mocks a user session (eval iterations, synthetic chatbox
 * sessions).
 *
 * Grown out of the eval-only `browser-eval-context.ts` (PR 14): the harness
 * wiring is surface-neutral, so the same context now serves every consumer
 * through two attachment styles:
 *
 *   Engine paths (`runAssistantTurn` → `runChatEngineLoop`):
 *   - `computerWidgetTools` — wire-format `computer` + `finish_widget` tools
 *     (regular function tools; the provider-native factory's lazy schema
 *     serializes to an empty object on the Convex `/stream` wire). Merged into
 *     the tool map the runner passes to `runAssistantTurn`, executed locally by
 *     `executeToolCallsFromMessages`, with screenshots reaching the model as
 *     image content via the tool's `toModelOutput` (honored by the shared
 *     executor since PR 14).
 *   - `prepareAdvertisedTools` — hides both tools until a widget is actually
 *     mounted in the harness (the engine additionally enforces execution
 *     against the advertised subset).
 *   - `handleEngineToolResult` — the engine's `onToolResult` hook (awaited by
 *     `emitToolResults` since PR 14, so a rendered widget is mounted before the
 *     next step's gate runs). Renders MCP App tool results in the harness and
 *     records `RunnerWidgetRenderObservation`s.
 *   - `noteToolCallInput` — the engine's `onToolCall` hook; caches tool-call
 *     inputs so the render hook can feed the OpenAI-compat shim the same
 *     `toolInput` the live widget would have received.
 *
 *   Local AI-SDK paths (`runDirectChatTurn`):
 *   - `handleDirectToolResultChunk` — the `traceEvents.onToolResultChunk`
 *     hook (awaited by the helper). The chunk already carries the normalized
 *     tool input, so no input cache is involved.
 *   - The same `computerWidgetTools` / `prepareAdvertisedTools` attach to the
 *     helper's tool map and prepareStep gate. Note the tools stay wire-format
 *     here too: the local consumers (eval local-BYOK, simulation local org
 *     BYOK) share finalize/persistence paths with hosted runs, and the
 *     function-tool surface works on every provider.
 *
 * One context per session/iteration; `dispose()` MUST run (callers wrap the
 * body in try/finally) so a launched Chromium never outlives its session.
