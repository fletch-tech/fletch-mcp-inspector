/**
 * Run recipes: the OPERATOR OVERRIDE table (rung 0 of the resolution ladder).
 *
 * This started life as the ONE hardcoded piece of the GitHub-checks walking
 * skeleton — the unsolved problem in "test an arbitrary MCP server's PR" is not
 * the testing but knowing how to build and start the server, so the plumbing was
 * built first against a single controlled fixture repo. The resolution ladder
 * (declared config → detection → agentic fallback) has since landed, and this
 * table is no longer how any repo is expected to resolve. It is an operator
 * ESCAPE HATCH, and it is deliberately EMPTY.
 *
 * ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 * │ WHAT AN ENTRY HERE COSTS — read before adding one.                      │
 * │                                                                         │
 * │ The override rung sits ABOVE the declared rung (resolver/index.ts): an  │
 * │ override outranks a repo's own `mcpjam.yaml` even when both exist. So   │
 * │ an entry here MASKS that repository's declared config for as long as it │
 * │ is present, and every check on that repo resolves through this table    │
 * │ instead of through the ladder.                                          │
 * │                                                                         │
 * │ That is exactly how the fixture entry that used to live here made the   │
 * │ ladder untestable: deleting the fixture's yaml, breaking it, or         │
 * │ exercising detection all produced the same override recipe and the same │
 * │ green check. A smoke test that goes green while testing nothing.        │
 * │                                                                         │
 * │ Add an entry only to unblock a repo the ladder genuinely cannot resolve │
 * │ (and prefer fixing the ladder), remove it as soon as it is unblocked,   │
 * │ and update the guard test that asserts this table is empty — the guard  │
 * │ exists so the cost is acknowledged rather than discovered later.        │
 * └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * A repo with no recipe at all resolves to `recipe_unresolvable` (a NEUTRAL
 * check — "we couldn't figure this out", never a failure attributed to the PR).
