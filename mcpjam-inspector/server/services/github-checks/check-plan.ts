/**
 * The BACKEND-OWNED plan / verdict loop, from the worker's side.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT THIS MODULE MOVED OUT OF THE INSPECTOR, AND WHY
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Settled architecture (plan 5, 08-03): the moat is the DATA FLYWHEEL, not the
 * security logic. Sandbox execution stays open and inspectable — attackers
 * observe behaviour anyway, and correctness must never depend on secrecy. What
 * compounds across repositories is which recipes worked, why attempts failed,
 * and how candidates get ordered. So:
 *
 *   THE INSPECTOR STOPPED    ordering candidates; deciding continue/stop;
 *                            computing the final outcome. `resolveAndStart`'s
 *                            local attribution mapping is gone — it reports a
 *                            `failureKind` and the backend derives the verdict.
 *   THE INSPECTOR KEPT       deterministic `mcpjam.yaml` parsing and detection;
 *                            clone/build/start/probe; E2B lifecycle; cleanup;
 *                            `/proc` listener identity; telemetry. All still in
 *                            the open.
 *
 * The accepted cost, named: a check now depends on this backend mid-flight, so
 * a self-hosted Inspector cannot run checks standalone. That is the moat
 * working as intended, and it is a deliberate position rather than an emergent
 * one.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE SEQUENCE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 *   1. claim (unchanged)
 *   2. POST /plan/begin { triggerId, repoFullName, headSha } → { planId }
 *      ← FIRST, before ANY sandbox work. Provisioning, cloning and detection
 *        all fail BEFORE candidates exist, and a derived completion REQUIRES a
 *        planId; minting the shell up front is what makes those failures
 *        attributable through the ordinary path instead of needing a second,
 *        planless completion contract forever.
 *   3. provision → clone → bounded reads, each reported as a LADDER attempt
 *      (no candidateId)
 *   4. the deterministic ladder → localCandidates
 *   5. compute the evidence digest (this repo is the SOLE encoder)
 *   6. POST /plan/candidates → { candidates[], stopPolicy }
 *   7. execute the candidates IN THE PLAN'S ORDER, fresh box per candidate
 *   8. obey the typed ACTION returned by every /attempt
 *   9. on `run_eval`: launch the suite, then IMMEDIATELY post
 *      { phase:'eval', ok:true, runId } — that attempt is what BINDS the run
 *   10. POST /complete { triggerId, planId, runId } — NO `outcome` field
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THREE RULES THAT ARE EASY TO SOFTEN AND MUST NOT BE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * 1. A 409 IS A HARD STOP, NEVER RETRIED. It means we violated the state
 *    machine — we cited a candidate out of order, reported a phase backwards,
 *    kept going after a stop, or asserted something untrue about this check.
 *    Retrying cannot make any of those true. The reason is surfaced in the
 *    check output and the run stops.
 * 2. DEGRADED MODE IS A CONTRACT. Backend unreachable after the claim ⇒ stop
 *    conservatively and report `backend_unreachable`, which the backend
 *    attributes as `infra_error`. Never a green, never a PR-blamed outcome, and
 *    NEVER a silent local fallback to our own candidate policy — behaviour must
 *    not differ invisibly between healthy and degraded runs.
 * 3. AN UNKNOWN ACTION IS THE SAME CASE. A response we cannot interpret is no
 *    more evidence about the pull request than no response at all, so it fails
 *    closed to `complete` + the degraded marker.
