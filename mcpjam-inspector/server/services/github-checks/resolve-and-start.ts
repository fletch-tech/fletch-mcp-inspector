/**
 * `resolveAndStart` — the boxes, the deterministic ladder, and the runtime
 * identity check, driven by the BACKEND'S plan.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT THIS MODULE STOPPED DOING (A3b-2), AND WHY THAT IS THE POINT
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * It used to own the attribution model: which candidate to try, in what order,
 * whether a failure was a resolver MISS or the author's `build_failed`, and
 * what the whole thing added up to. All of that now lives in
 * `convex/github/checkPlans.ts`, because the DATA FLYWHEEL is the moat and the
 * sandbox execution is not — and because "a candidate's build failure is a miss,
 * not a red X" should be a backend edit rather than an Inspector deploy.
 *
 * So this module reports FACTS and obeys ACTIONS:
 *
 *   - every phase boundary is a `/attempt` with a `failureKind` when it failed;
 *   - the returned action (`continue_phase` | `try_next_candidate` | `run_eval`
 *     | `complete`) is honoured verbatim, and an action we do not recognize is
 *     treated as `complete` (fail closed — see `check-plan.ts`);
 *   - nothing here computes an outcome, and there is no local fall-back
 *     ordering. A backend we cannot reach means we STOP, never that we quietly
 *     revert to our own policy.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY KEPT — all of it in the open
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A FRESH SANDBOX PER CANDIDATE. Candidate B never runs in candidate A's box,
 * and A's box is KILLED BEFORE B's is provisioned (not merely before B's build):
 *
 *   1. EGRESS KEEPS THE PLATFORM BASELINE. The box is provisioned with public
 *      internet and the backend's non-guest RFC1918 denylist. `buildAndStart`
 *      never changes that policy, so B's build and server see the same network
 *      behavior as A's.
 *   2. A's PROCESSES ARE STILL ALIVE. A's server may hold the port, and it is
 *      A's code — so B's probe would be answered by A, which is the exact
 *      wrong-process-answering-the-probe class the runtime check below exists
 *      to close, reintroduced by our own reuse.
 *
 * THE RUNTIME LISTENER-IDENTITY CHECK. It runs AFTER the probe answers and
 * BEFORE the server is accepted, and it asks what static analysis provably
 * cannot: is the process bound to the probed port the start command WE spawned,
 * or a descendant of it? That closes the install-hook class — `"prepare":
 * "nohup acme-server &"` and its endless spellings — where a detached published
 * server squats the port and answers our probe while the validated start
 * command never binds.
 *
 * IDENTITY COMES FROM THE SPAWN, NOT FROM THE BOX. `buildAndStart` returns a
 * `SpawnIdentity` — the pid E2B reports for the command it started for us, plus
 * the process group read from `/proc/<pid>/stat` at that instant. Everything in
 * the box after the build is PR code, so an identity fact the box WRITES is one
 * the PR chooses: an earlier revision had the start wrapper write its pid to
 * `/tmp/mcp-server.pid` and read it back, and a squatter could overwrite that
 * file and be recognised as ours. The box is only ever asked for kernel facts.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO RUNTIME "OWNERSHIP" CHECK. An earlier revision resolved the
 * listening process's MAIN MODULE from `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, `realpath`d it and
 * required it inside the checkout and outside `node_modules`. Removed: `tsx
 * src/index.ts` runs as `node .../node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs src/index.ts`
 * and `uv run python -m server` has no file-valued argument at all, so it
 * rejected ordinary servers; a path-valued option accepted things that are not
 * code; and it never caught the motivating case anyway (a build that COPIES a
 * dependency into the tree produces a main module inside the checkout). What
 * covers what now: STATIC entry validation in `detect.ts` rule C, and the
 * RUNTIME listener identity here. `ownershipProof: 'unverified'` records the
 * residual honestly instead of pretending it is settled.

 * the build, the clone and the start command all sit in one group, and a
