/**
 * Server-served skills (SEP-2640) in a chat turn — the LIVE path.
 *
 * ## Why a composing wrapper, not a fifth skills source
 *
 * `prepareChatV2`'s skills chain (`chat-v2-orchestration.ts`) is an
 * EXCLUSIVE choice: pinned OR resolved OR cloud OR local. Server skills are
 * not an alternative to any of those — a turn can have both a Computer skill
 * and a skill served by a connected MCP server, and picking one would silently
 * drop the other. So this wraps whatever the chain produced.
 *
 * The wrapper is byte-identical to its input when no connected server declares
 * the extension, which is what keeps every existing turn unchanged.
 *
 * It wraps exactly the four `SKILL_TOOL_NAMES`, reusing them rather than
 * minting new tool names, so the double-delivery invariant ("only ONE
 * loadSkill surface per turn") and the built-in-vs-skill collision rules are
 * untouched.
 *
 * ## Dispatch
 *
 * A server skill is addressed by REF (`<serverSlug>/<name>`) or by URI. A BARE
 * NAME never resolves to a server skill: bare names belong to the base source,
 * and letting a server claim one would be a shadowing channel. Anything the
 * wrapper does not recognise is delegated to the base tool unchanged.
 *
 * ## Approval
 *
 * Loading a server skill is ALWAYS approval-gated — even when the host's
 * `requireToolApproval` is false. The content is untrusted instructions
 * fetched from a third party mid-turn, so the user has to see WHICH skill they
 * are admitting; the approval card carries the tool name and its input, which
 * is the skill ref or URI.
 *
 * SEP-2640 binds host trust to a specific DIGEST SET, and {@link
 * manifestApprovalHash} computes that binding. The binding is ENFORCED: the
 * `needsApproval` gate resolves the target and records the digest set before
 * the prompt is shown, and `execute` recomputes it afterwards and refuses when
 * it moved. So an approval covers a specific manifest, and a server that
 * republishes between the prompt and the load gets a refusal rather than a
 * pass.
 *
 * What it is NOT is VISIBLE. The approval payload carries `toolName`, `input`
 * and `telemetryScope` — there is no field for the hash, and the card renders
 * as "Run <tool>". So the user sees which skill they are admitting, not which
 * manifest version; two loads of the same ref across a republish look
 * identical to them even though the second is refused. Closing that needs a
 * field on the shared approval payload and a change to the renderer every tool
 * uses, which is a wider change than this PR should make.
 *
 * The distinction is worth stating precisely: the digest set is a real gate,
 * and it is not a disclosure. A security property the code does not have is
 * worse than one it never promised.
