/**
 * Effective auth-method resolution for connect-time dispatch — the single
 * predicate all three surfaces (local resolver, hosted web/auth routes, swarm
 * runs) must share so `auto` behaves identically everywhere.
 *
 * `auto` resolves to XAA when the server is XAA-configured — a hard selection
 * before the flow starts, never a fallback after a failed attempt (a failed
 * XAA mint surfaces the error rather than retrying as OAuth, which would mask
 * config errors as confusing OAuth 401s). Otherwise `auto` resolves to
 * "discover": use a stored OAuth token when one exists, else connect
 * UNAUTHENTICATED and let a 401 from the target escalate to the interactive
 * OAuth flow. That is the MCP spec's canonical client sequence
 * (unauthenticated request → 401 + WWW-Authenticate → discovery → OAuth),
 * not a fallback-after-failure.
 *
 * NOTE: dispatch sites branch on equality (`=== "oauth"`), not exhaustive
 * switches — adding a member here does NOT produce compile errors at
 * unhandled sites. Every consumer must be audited by hand (currently
 * local-server-resolver.ts and routes/web/auth.ts).
 *
 * The canonical `authMethod` WINS over the derived/legacy `useOAuth`/`useXaa`
 * booleans (see feedback: canonical-wins-every-read-site); only rows with no
 * canonical method fall back to the boolean pair.
