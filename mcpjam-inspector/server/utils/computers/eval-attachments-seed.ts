/**
 * COMP-17 — seed an eval iteration's fresh ephemeral sandbox with the case's
 * attachments.
 *
 * Evals deliberately run on a fresh per-iteration sandbox (no personal
 * computer), so a case's attachments must be re-materialized into the box every
 * iteration to stay reproducible. The bytes live in Convex `_storage`, pinned by
 * content-hash into the run's `configSnapshot` at run start (mcpjam-backend
 * `testSuites.ts`); here we resolve those pins to short-lived download URLs
 * (`/evals/sandbox/attachments`) and write each file to its frozen path inside
 * the box via the E2B file API.
 *
 * Fail-honest (design §5): if anything prevents a file from landing — the pin
 * vanished (`url: null`), a download fails, a cap is exceeded, or the write
 * throws — this REJECTS so the caller fails the iteration. An eval that answers
 * "how many rows?" without its CSV looks like a passing result; a hard failure
 * is strictly better. Mirrors the tri-state skill-file contract (never treat a
 * fetch failure as "no files").
