/**
 * Remote data plane for Project Computers.
 *
 * Being the data plane requires `E2B_API_KEY` + the shared secrets —
 * credentials a locally-run OSS inspector must never hold (the vendor key is
 * billable; the secret resolves ANY user's sandbox id). Instead, a local
 * server can name a deployed inspector via the NON-secret
 * `COMPUTERS_REMOTE_DATA_PLANE_URL` and forward both data-plane operations
 * there, keeping authorization per-user end to end:
 *
 *   - terminal: the browser opens its WebSocket against the remote origin
 *     (advertised via GET /api/web/computers/config); auth is unchanged —
 *     the Convex-minted per-user terminal token works on any data plane
 *     holding the verify secret.
 *   - bash exec: `execViaRemoteDataPlane` POSTs /api/web/computers/exec with
 *     the user's bearer; the remote forwards it to Convex `/computers/reserve`
 *     which authorizes exactly as if that server had received the chat turn.
 *
 * Local configuration (real secrets) always wins over the remote URL — a
 * deployed data plane never delegates, so there is no forwarding loop.
 *
 * `COMPUTERS_REMOTE_DATA_PLANE_URL` is an explicit override, not the primary
 * path — hand-setting it per environment (per dev laptop, per PR preview) is
 * exactly the manual-config problem this module exists to avoid. When it's
 * unset, `initComputersRemoteDataPlaneDiscovery` (called once at server
 * startup) asks THIS deployment's own Convex for the answer via the
 * non-secret `/computers/data-plane-url` route (`mcpjam-backend
 * convex/computersDataPlane.ts`) and caches it — every server pointed at the
 * same Convex deployment auto-discovers the same data plane with zero
 * per-environment config.
