/**
 * Skill-metadata context budget (INS-3).
 *
 * OpenAI's plugin guidance caps the skill DISCOVERY listing — the names and
 * descriptions every turn pays for, before the model has chosen anything — at
 * 2% of the model's context. MCPJam adopts that number directly rather than
 * inventing one: a plugin authored against OpenAI's budget must behave the same
 * here, or an eval run in MCPJam stops predicting the plugin's real behavior.
 *
 * The budget is stated in TOKENS and enforced here in CHARACTERS, because the
 * listing is assembled as a string long before any tokenizer sees it. We use
 * the conventional ~4 chars/token English approximation. It is an
 * approximation on purpose: exact tokenization would need the model's own
 * tokenizer at list time, and the failure it would prevent (a listing a few
 * percent over budget) is not worth a per-model tokenizer dependency.
 *
 * Ordering of the two remedies is the load-bearing part, and comes from the
 * plan: TRUNCATE descriptions before OMITTING skills. A truncated description
 * still lets the model find the skill and call `loadSkill`, which delivers the
 * full body; an omitted skill is invisible and unreachable. Omission is the
 * last resort and is always reported.
