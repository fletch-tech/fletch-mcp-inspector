/**
 * Shared web-chat streaming turn.
 *
 * Encapsulates the streaming/persistence/provider-branching body that both
 * `web/chat-v2` and `web/mcpjam-agent` share. Extracted verbatim from
 * `web/chat-v2.ts` (commit history) so behavior is identical for the original
 * caller — see `feedback_mechanical_commit_framing` for why this lives in its
 * own commit.
 *
 * The caller is responsible for:
 *   - Parsing the inbound body.
 *   - Constructing the MCPClientManager (`createAuthorizedManager` for
 *     project-server chats, ad-hoc for self-hosted agent surfaces).
 *   - Pre-building the `hostConfig` payload (only direct-chat callers do;
 *     other callers omit it).
 *
 * This helper owns:
 *   - `prepareChatV2` (with the Anthropic-tool-name 400 catch).
 *   - The `isMCPJam` / org-BYOK / local-runtime branch.
 *   - Constructing `onConversationComplete` → `persistChatSessionToConvex`
 *     with optional tool-snapshot capture, gated on `manager.hasServer`.
 *   - `cleanupStream` → `manager.disconnectAllServers()`.
 *   - Throwing/propagating errors; the caller is expected to catch and run
 *     its own OAuth-error enrichment if applicable.

  /**
   * Observe in-process tool-call failures from every ToolSet-driven engine to
   * surface out-of-band notices.
   *
   * Wrapped here, on the tool set, rather than in the engines: `prepareChatV2`
   * builds this set once and all three consumers share it (MCPJam-free,
   * org-BYOK local, org-BYOK hosted). The org branches run `runDirectChatTurn`,
   * where the AI SDK owns the tool loop and never touches the shared
   * `executeToolCallsFromMessages` catch — so an engine-level hook compiled
   * fine and silently never fired for BYOK users, who advertise and handle
   * elicitation like everyone else.
   *
   * Wrapped UNCONDITIONALLY (not gated on the elicitation bridge): each emit
   * guards on its own channel. `url_required` still rides the bridge only, so it
   * stays a no-op without one — identical to before. `insufficient_scope` is a
   * display-only step-up notice that must fire whether or not elicitation was
   * advertised, so it falls back to the raw stream writer when there is no
   * bridge (SEP-2350).
   *
   * Harness MCP-server tools execute out of process through `.mcp.json` and
   * therefore use the correlated harness-proxy side channel instead. Host-
   * executed harness tools still pass through this set.
   *
   * The shared wrapper rethrows always: this only observes. The engines' own
   * error handling still produces the tool result the model sees.
