/**
 * `bash` bound to an EPHEMERAL SANDBOX — a disposable box the caller already
 * provisioned for this unit of work.
 *
 * Unlike the chat `bash` tool (`built-in-tools/bash.ts`), which resolves the
 * caller's PERSONAL computer via reserve→sandbox-info, this binds directly to a
 * KNOWN sandbox id (mcpjam-backend `evalSandboxes.provisionEvalSandbox` for an
 * eval iteration, `journeySandboxes.provisionJourneySandbox` for a swarm
 * attempt, `chatboxSandboxes.provisionChatboxSandbox` for a chatbox
 * conversation). The personal computer stays banned from all three: it is
 * mutable per-user state that a reproducible run can't reproduce, and — the
 * reason swarm bash was suppressed outright in #3595 — every session would
 * otherwise SHARE one box, so one session's writes leak into the next.
 *
 * LIFETIME IS PART OF THE CONTRACT, not a comment. Eval and swarm boxes die
 * with their unit of work; a chatbox box survives between the turns of one
 * conversation. `opts.lifetime` picks which of those the tool DESCRIPTION
 * states, because a model that believes its files vanish behaves differently
 * from one that knows they persist.
 *
 * `execute` returns `{ error }` instead of throwing so the model relays
 * problems conversationally rather than breaking the turn.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP (flagged follow-up, not a blocker): commands run here are not
 * written to the durable command log the personal path records via
 * `recordComputerCommand`. An ephemeral box has no `projectComputers` row to
 * attribute a command to, so auditing needs its own scope-aware surface.
