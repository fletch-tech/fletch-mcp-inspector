 * Write-path idempotency for unattended callers.
 *
 * An unattended caller — the Slack bot, the scheduled worker — is exactly the
 * caller that retries. If a turn crashes after persisting an eval suite but
 * before its reply lands, the retry has to run again, and its mutations must
 * land on the SAME rows rather than authoring a second suite and billing a
 * second run.
 *
 * The key is carried on a HEADER rather than in the request body, for two
 * reasons:
 *
 *   1. It is transport metadata, not part of any operation's public schema.
 *      The agent's tool schemas are model-facing; a model must never be able
 *      to invent, omit, or vary an idempotency key, because the key is the
 *      whole safety property.
 *   2. It applies uniformly to every write route without each one having to
 *      grow (and correctly forward) another body field.

 * constant, which is exactly the collision this exists to avoid: two materially
 * different inputs would share an idempotency key, and the second write would

 * So this walks iteratively with an explicit stack and treats a repeated
 * reference as a back-edge marker instead of following it. Every exit is a
 * value, so no input can fall through to a constant. Keys are sorted here too,
 * which the `JSON.stringify` version did not do — structurally identical
 * subtrees built in a different key order now agree.
 *
 * NOTHING IS TRUNCATED. An earlier version stopped at a node budget and emitted
 * a fixed marker, which reintroduced the collision one layer down: every input
 * whose tail fell past the budget shared a digest, so a later write with a
 * different tail could replay an earlier one. A fingerprint that silently stops
 * distinguishing is worse than no fingerprint, because the caller cannot tell.
 * The bound that matters is upstream — the request body is size-limited before
 * it ever reaches here — and reading an input you have already accepted is
 * work you have already agreed to do.
