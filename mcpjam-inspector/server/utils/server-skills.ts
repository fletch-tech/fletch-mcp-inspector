/**
 * Server-served Agent Skills (SEP-2640) — the verified read path.
 *
 * ONE module sits between every MCPJam surface (routes, chat tools, the
 * capture coordinator, the CLI) and a `skills/*` call, because the SEP's
 * integrity rules are only rules if there is no second way in:
 *
 *   - every SKILL.md is fetched via `resources/read` and verified against its
 *     manifest digest before any caller sees a byte;
 *   - a read of a URI absent from the manifest is a FAILURE, never a fetch;
 *   - the fetched frontmatter is re-checked field-by-field against what the
 *     listing advertised, and the name against the URI's final segment;
 *   - a skill with NO manifest is refused outright. SEP-2640 says a host MAY
 *     load content it cannot verify; MCPJam declines, and says so.
 *
 * Everything here is manager-shaped rather than route-shaped so the local
 * (long-lived manager) and hosted (ephemeral per-request manager) paths share
 * one implementation. The SDK owns the wire and the crypto; this module owns
 * the ORCHESTRATION and the refusals.
 *
 * PIN: modelcontextprotocol/docs @ d7490ec.
