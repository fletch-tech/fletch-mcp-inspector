/**
 * Runtime skill delivery for the harness path — the single module that owns the
 * "skills as a runtime concern" mechanics, decoupled from any one adapter.
 *
 * One Convex source of truth (`projectSkills`), delivered to the in-sandbox agent
 * via the harness `skills` param (the adapter writes them natively — Claude Code →
 * `~/.claude/skills`, Codex → a protocol param). This module provides:
 *
 *   - `fetchRuntimeSkills` — TRI-STATE fetch. A transient Convex failure is
 *     `{ ok: false }`, never an empty list, so callers can distinguish "no skills"
 *     from "couldn't load" and avoid wiping the box or churning the session.
 *   - `skillsFingerprint` — deterministic hash folded into the harness runtime
 *     fingerprint so a skill add/edit/delete invalidates a resumable session
 *     (the adapter only (re)writes skills on a fresh start).
 *   - `toHarnessSkills` — adapter-agnostic payload with SEMANTIC descriptions.
 *   - `frontmatterSafeSkills` — shim for adapters that interpolate
 *     `description: ${value}` RAW into SKILL.md frontmatter (Claude Code's
 *     `claude-code-harness.ts` and Codex's `codex-harness.ts` both do): it
 *     pre-encodes the description as a YAML double-quoted scalar. YAML safety
 *     lives here, NOT in the generic conversion, so an adapter that composes
 *     frontmatter structurally still gets clean text.
 *   - `prepareClaudeCodeSkills` / `prepareCodexSkills` — the per-adapter
 *     `HarnessRuntimeAdapter.prepareSkills` implementations: the `skills` param
 *     payload AND which skills that actually amounts to, so the caller's own
 *     passes (supporting files, frontmatter, dir reconcile) address exactly the
 *     dirs the adapter will write.
