/**
 * Cheap, synchronous pre-flight for a harness-typed host (Claude Code | Codex).
 *
 * `runHarnessTurn` already fails closed deep in the stream when a prerequisite
 * is missing, but by then the UI has opened a turn and the error surfaces as a
 * raw mid-stream message. The chat-v2 routes call this BEFORE streaming so a
 * harness-typed host with an unavailable runtime gets one clear, friendly error
 * instead — and we never silently fall back to the emulated engine (that would
 * mislead the user into thinking they observed the real harness).
 *
 * Rules are driven by the adapter's declared CAPABILITIES (requiresComputer,
 * approval surfaces, MCP support), not hardcoded per-harness — so a new harness
 * gets the right gates for free. Only the cheap synchronous checks live here —
 * including the inspector-side BROKER DELIVERY kill switch (an env read), the
 * only credential path since COMP-23. The backend broker/proxy flags (a network
 * call away) stay in-turn fail-closed backstops, as do expensive runtime
 * failures (computer wake, E2B connect).
