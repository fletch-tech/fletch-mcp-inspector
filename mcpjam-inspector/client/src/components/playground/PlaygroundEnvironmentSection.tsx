/**
 * Playground "Environments" section (Project Environments — Phase 2.5).
 *
 * Rendered by {@link import("./PlaygroundHostPicker").PlaygroundHostPicker} and
 * by the Playground header's leading slot. Flag gating is the CALLER's job (see
 * `useProjectEnvironmentsEnabled`, fail-closed) — this component renders nothing
 * on its own when no environment is selected beyond the picker itself.
 *
 * Scope discipline, worth stating because the surrounding surface looks like it
 * contradicts it: model, temperature, system prompt and approval remain
 * EPHEMERAL Playground controls. Touching them here does not edit the
 * environment, and the server keeps `override-wins` for exactly those fields on
 * an environment turn. Editing an environment happens on `/environments`.
 *
 * The server list is rendered ID-FIRST from the preview's `{ serverId, name,
 * source }` entries and is never merged into the ordinary project-server list:
 * plugin-contributed servers are deliberately hidden from
 * `servers:getProjectServers`, so the name-keyed catalog cannot represent them.
