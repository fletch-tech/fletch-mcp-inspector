/**
 * The route table, as data.
 *
 * `router.tsx` maps each entry to a React element; the coverage tests read
 * this module alone. That split is the point: `router.tsx` eagerly imports
 * ~30 route components from the App monolith, so a test importing it would
 * drag PostHog, Convex, and every store into jsdom to answer a question
 * about strings.
 *
 * Every route declares its `kind`, so a non-screen is an explicit, typed
 * decision rather than an entry on an exceptions list somewhere else:
 *
 *   - `screen`   — a real user destination. MUST name a manifest in
 *                  `shared/app-surfaces.ts`; CI fails otherwise, which is
 *                  what stops a new screen from shipping agent-invisible.
 *   - `redirect` — bounces elsewhere and renders nothing of its own.
 *   - `special`  — renders, but isn't a destination a user navigates to:
 *                  OAuth callbacks, the chrome-less embed, the catch-all.
