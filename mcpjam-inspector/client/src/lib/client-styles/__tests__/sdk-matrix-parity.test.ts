/**
 * The FULL / COPILOT / GOOSE / NO_CLAIMS surfaces are imported from
 * `@mcpjam/sdk/host-compat` (one source for the compat engine + this playground
 * emulation). The SDK types them sparse, so built-ins.ts casts them to the
 * client's resolved (all-required) shape. This guards that cast: if the SDK
 * ever drops a dimension, a cast would silently leave it `undefined` — these
 * assertions fail instead.
 *
 * `MCP_APPS_SLACK_SURFACE` stays a local, fully-typed resolved literal, so its
 * key set is the canonical reference.
 *
 * Deliberately coupled to the SDK's BUNDLED snapshot, not the live backend
 * catalog (CANI-2): playground emulation always runs on the constants shipped
 * in this build, so this parity guard must match those same constants.
