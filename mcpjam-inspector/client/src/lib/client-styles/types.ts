 *
 * Row meanings:
 *
 *   - `availableDisplayModes` — host-advertised display modes via

 *   - `toolInputPartial` / `toolCancelled` / `hostContextChanged` /
 *     `resourceTeardown` — gate whether the host emits the corresponding
 *     `ui/notifications/*` (or `ui/resource-teardown` request) to the View.
 *   - `toolInfo` — gate the `HostContext.toolInfo` field.
 *   - `serverResources` / `logging` — gate the matching `HostCapabilities`
 *     keys. Disabling `logging` also blocks `app.sendLog()` (the
 *     `notifications/message` View → Host channel is gated by this
 *     capability per the spec).
 *   - `sandboxPermissions` / `cspFrameDomains` / `cspBaseUriDomains` —
 *     gate whether the renderer honors the matching resource `_meta.ui`
 *     sandbox sub-fields when composing the iframe sandbox.
 *   - `resourcePrefersBorder` — gate whether the renderer honors
 *     `_meta.ui.prefersBorder` when rendering the iframe chrome.
