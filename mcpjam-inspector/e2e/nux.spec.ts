//
// The NUX logic (App.tsx useLayoutEffect):
//   1. Waits for isWorkOsLoading = false and effectiveHostedShellGateState = "ready".
//   2. Skips if hasSeenFirstRunOnboarding (remote Convex flag) is true.
//   3. Calls isFirstRunEligible(hasBlockingServers, activeTab, workOsUser, remoteFlag):
//      - returns true when the active route is the root hub ("/", "/home",
//        "/servers", "/connect", "/hosts") AND no blocking servers AND no prior
//        localStorage onboarding state.
//   4. On eligible: navigates to /playground.
//
// After the 2631 change, "/" and "/home" both render HomeTab (no feature-flag
// gate), so they qualify as eligible NUX entry routes.
