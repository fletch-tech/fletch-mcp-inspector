/**
 * The origin banner every server-served skill (SEP-2640) body is wrapped in.
 *
 * SHARED because two surfaces must produce it BYTE-IDENTICALLY:
 *   - `server/utils/server-skill-tools.ts`, when the model calls `loadSkill`;
 *   - the playground SKILLS popover, which fabricates a synthetic `loadSkill`
 *     tool-call message when a user clicks a skill.
 *
 * The popover's injected message is supposed to be indistinguishable from what
 * the tool would have returned — that is a load-bearing invariant of the chat
 * pipeline (see `chat-helpers.ts`), and two copies of this text would drift
 * the moment one is edited.
 *
 * ## Why the wording is what it is
 *
 * A digest match proves the bytes agree with what the server advertised in its
 * listing. That is CONSISTENCY, not trustworthiness: a hostile server digests
 * its hostile content perfectly. Saying "verified" alone would imply a trust
 * claim the check cannot support, so the banner states exactly what was
 * checked and then says plainly that the content is untrusted third-party
 * input.
 *
 * PIN: modelcontextprotocol/docs @ d7490ec.
