/**
 * Wire shapes for the LOCAL subscription bridge (MCP 2026-07-28 §13.2).
 *
 * The upstream subscription is owned by the LOCAL `MCPClientManager` (through
 * the SDK's `SubscriptionCoordinator`); the browser only *observes* it. These
 * are the observation shapes carried over `/api/mcp/subscriptions/stream`,
 * declared structurally here rather than re-exported from the SDK so the
 * client bundle never pulls the coordinator (a Node-side object) in for types.
 *
 * Every field the debugger needs to answer "what did the server actually agree
 * to send, on which subscription, and why did it stop" is on the wire:
 * requested vs acknowledged filter (separate facts, never merged), the MCP
 * subscription id and how it was bound, the lifecycle status, and the close
 * reason. Refusals travel too — an unrequested notification type is *shown as
 * rejected*, never silently dropped.
