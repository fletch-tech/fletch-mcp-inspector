# Testing XAA with a local MCP server and a cloud authorization server — no tunnel

The most common Cross-App Access (XAA) dev setup is:

- your **MCP server** running on `localhost`,
- your **authorization server** running in the cloud (Scalekit, Okta, Auth0, …),
- MCPJam running locally as the debugger.

Out of the box this breaks at issuer discovery: a local MCPJam run advertises an
issuer like `http://127.0.0.1:6274/api/mcp/xaa`, and a cloud authorization
server validating the ID-JAG can't fetch that issuer's discovery document or
JWKS. Historically the workaround was moving everything to
`app.mcpjam.com` and exposing your MCP server with ngrok.

The **"Use hosted issuer"** toggle (XAA tab → identity-provider bar) removes
the tunnel entirely. Only the *minting* of the mock ID token and ID-JAG needs a
publicly reachable issuer — so with the toggle on, your local MCPJam forwards
just those mint calls, server-to-server, to `app.mcpjam.com` using your
signed-in session. Everything else stays on your machine:

| Step | Where it runs |
| --- | --- |
| Mock SSO + ID-JAG mint | `app.mcpjam.com` (forwarded, signed by the hosted key) |
| ID-JAG → access token at *your* AS | your machine → your cloud AS |
| MCP request with the access token | your machine → `localhost` MCP server |

## Setup

1. Sign in to MCPJam locally (the toggle is disabled for guests — a local
   guest session can't authenticate to the hosted issuer).
2. In the XAA tab, flip **Use hosted issuer (app.mcpjam.com)**. The issuer /
   OpenID config / JWKS chips switch to your **organization-scoped** hosted
   issuer:

   ```
   https://app.mcpjam.com/api/web/xaa/o/<your-org-id>
   ```

3. In your authorization server, trust that issuer for ID-JAGs (issuer URL or
   JWKS URL — both resolve to the same keys) and register the client ID the
   debugger presents.
4. Run the flow. The decoded ID-JAG's `iss` is the hosted issuer; the token
   request and the final MCP call originate from your machine.

## Why the issuer is organization-scoped

Minting under `…/xaa/o/<orgId>` requires being a signed-in member of that
organization, so an authorization server that trusts your scoped issuer can
only receive assertions minted by your org's members. The legacy unscoped
issuer (`https://app.mcpjam.com/api/web/xaa`) is mintable by anyone with an
MCPJam session — treat it as throwaway/test-only and prefer the scoped issuer
whenever you register MCPJam in a real authorization server.

## Known limitation: runtime XAA connect still uses the unscoped issuer

The **debugger** advertises and mints under the org-scoped issuer
(`…/o/<orgId>`). The **runtime** XAA connect path (a normal server connection
that authenticates via XAA, in `server/routes/web/auth.ts` /
`server/utils/local-server-resolver.ts`) still mints under the unscoped issuer
(`resolveXaaIssuer` → `/api/web/xaa`). So a customer who registers the
org-scoped issuer from the debugger can pass the debugger but have a real
connect/token-exchange fail on `iss` mismatch. Plumbing org-scoped issuers into
runtime connect (with the same membership gate) is a follow-up; until then, for
a live connection register the unscoped issuer, or use the debugger only for
issuer/JWKS validation.

## Notes and limits

- **This mode is for a *remote* authorization server.** The hosted issuer only
  helps when your AS is somewhere it can reach — i.e. a public https AS. A
  `localhost`/plain-http AS is contradictory here: the positive flow's token
  request still runs from your machine and may reach it, but the **negative
  test scorecard** is fired from the hosted service and will reject a
  loopback/http endpoint (`URL not allowed`). If your AS is local, keep the
  toggle **off** and use the local issuer.
- **Negative tests** are forwarded too, so the broken assertions carry the same
  hosted `iss` as the positive run — otherwise every case would be rejected for
  issuer mismatch and the scorecard would "pass" without testing anything.
- **Sign in to the same organization the hosted issuer validates against.** The
  mint targets `…/o/<your-org-id>`, and app.mcpjam.com checks org membership
  against its own (production) backend. Point your local inspector's
  `VITE_CONVEX_URL` at the same backend and be a member of that org, or the
  hosted mint fails closed with an authorization error. The toggle is disabled
  when you have no active organization.
- **Staging / self-hosted origin:** override the hosted origin with
  `MCPJAM_HOSTED_ORIGIN` on the inspector **server** and the matching
  `VITE_MCPJAM_HOSTED_ORIGIN` at **client** build time. Set both — the server
  relays the mint there and the client advertises that origin's discovery/JWKS
  URLs, so a mismatch would name a different key than signs the token. Both
  default to `https://app.mcpjam.com`.
